Hi everybody. It's me, Tim. Today I want to talk about Fallout's memory model.

I had a good time talking about the foot sliding problem in the previous video and that was kind of where programming and art came together. This talk is purely programming. It is how we addressed memory use in Fallout — Fallout one. For those of you who are using numbers, It's a an incredibly good example of game development in the 90s. In fact, it's such a 90s story that if you listen carefully in the background you can probably hear Germany reunifying, what you need to know as context. Well, I'm going to give a lot of context.

PCs were wildly different, there were — we were making games for IBM, PC and Tandes there you know — a lot of different manufacturers, lots of different video cards. I talked about how Vasa became popular enough that by the time we made Fallout we could just assume people would have a Vasa driver, where in my previous game, Rags to Riches couldn't assume that and you had to ask people what kind of card they had. What's important for this video is that the minimum spec for Fallout was very low, particularly for memory. It was 16meg is not a lot, It's very little memory. It's to put it in a visual perspective: If you're looking at the screen for Fallout, which is 640480, 48 of those screens is all the memory we had for the entire game to run in. So all the code, all the data we had to keep, all the art we had to load 48 of those screens tops.

So that wasn't much memory. We actually, to be honest, we had far less, because it we said you need a 16meg machine and of course the Windows or DOSs took up space on that and other things took up space. We didn't have a lot of memory to work with. So we had to be really careful with it and we tried, but in the end we had to handle memory oursel.

And this is basically the story of why fall was made on the Wattcom C compiler. Now I'm going to tell you I like that compiler. So don't mis, don't misconstrue this story. I like that compiler but with a big butt. And I like big butts And I cannot lie.

This is the story of me finding a really, really bad bug in the compiler very early on. I think this happened in 94. Might have been 95,, but I'm pretty sure it was 94.

I was working on the very early version of Fallout's engine and I was getting memory overwrites and that occurs when you're writing out data and it's going to the wrong places. Like I'll I'd write out data, I discovered it because I was writing out, I was zeroing out. Some memory and some other data got zeroed out and it took me a while but I traced it to real, which is one of the standard C library calls. C lets you handle memory with basically three um functions: Maloc, which you say I want a block this big, and it gives you the block. Realic, which is you give it a block and say I need this block to change size, either smaller or bigger, and it gives you back a pointer to a new block which contain which is the size you asked for and if there was any data, it transferred it over. And then free, which just says I'm done with this block, you can get rid of it I found a problem with realic specifically. Sometimes real would give me a block that Wattcom had already given to someone else as memory. I wrote them because back then customer support had an email. I emailed them and they didn't believe me In their defense.

I'm sure they get tons of people telling them the compiler's broken. And it's not really. It's just they wrote bad code. Bad programmers love to blame everyone else for their code. Actually, bad people do that on everything they do.

But anyway, so what I did is I wrote a very simple program. It was just a few lines long. What it did is it maloclocked a bunch of blocks. So it made an array of blocks and the array stored the pointer to the block and how big it was. And that was important, then I made a loop and that loop was really simple. It would pick one of those blocks and reallocate to a new size. Remember, react changed the size of the memory block. Then it would loop over all the blocks. And would make sure that, given where they started and how big they were, none of them overlapped. And if it did, it would print out like memory integrity failed.

Very simple program, you know: set, create the blocks and then a loop that just said realloc, check. You could run that program and within seconds it would stop and say memory integrity failed. So I mailed them that program and I said I'm pretty sure the bug's in your compiler. If it's not, tell me where the bug is in this piece of code. A few days later they wrote me back and they said we have a bug in Realic.

We will fix it. The patch will be out soon, so luckily we got that fixed.

Just so you know, moving forward, it was very difficult to trust you'd find a bug and you're like: is that me or is it Wattcom? But I can tell you something: Other people at Interplay were using Microsoft's compiler and I'd hear things from them like I don't know if this is a bug with me or a bug with the compiler, because frequently back then the optimization flags would introduce bugs. So you'd optimize for time or for space. So you'd have ask it to compact how much memory you're using. Or you say, "Hey, make this, chunk of code, as fast as you can compile, as you can optimize it".

And sometimes those flags would introduce mistakes. So anyway, it wasn't just WCOM. I moved past it, but what we decided to do was moving forward. We decided to handle memory oursel And I will describe how that worked. When Fallout started, it called Maloc one time and grabbed one enormous block of memory and just went boom and set it aside And we never called.

Maloc again. What we did was when the game needed a block, it would call one of our functions and it would give a portion of the memory out of that big block. So we handled Maloc Real and Free ourselves using that one block of memory that when the game started it grabbed.

If it couldn't grab it, you weren't a Minsspec machine. The cool thing about this is the game itself didn't store direct pointers to the block. So you didn't. You weren't returned a pointer to a block in memory. You were given a handle And if you wanted to actually use that handle, you would call a function saying: "Hey, lock it, Lock the handle" And that lock would return the pointer that you used And while that block was locked that pointer was always valid And then when you unlocked it, wasn't th wasn't thrown away, but you couldn't. Access that memory block again unless you locked the handle.

And the reason for this was compaction. What we could do is if we had that one big block of memory and we had a lot of blocks that were assigned inside of it, any block that wasn't locked we could move it, We could copy it to a new location and copy, you know, in including It's all the data it had And we knew, because it wasn't locked, nobody was using that pointer. So it was safe to do so. Why would we want to do this?

Well, what we discovered when we were starting to develop Fallout — because we had so much data we had to store and the game was Super VGA, which at the time was new and was using way more memory than VGA — We discovered that many times the game would run out of memory. But it wasn't out of memory, It was just out of contiguous memory, like somewhere somebody would go, "Give me a thousand bytes" And it would go, "Can't give you a thousand bytes" But the total memory being used wasn't the full size of that block, It was just. There was no place where a thousand bytes were free in one contiguous line.

There may be 500 here and 500 here, because we used handles. We could take every block that wasn't locked and shove it down. So compact it into one spot, which would free up. All the memory that was free, would be one big block. This allowed us to get by on much less memory than we would have had to use if blocks were just being created and destroyed and fragmenting up memory. This in turn let Fallout run on much lower spec machines than it should have been able to at the time.

And this was really important to Interplay and to marketing, because more people could buy it opened up the number of people who could play this game. Now I'll tell you: these days you tell those people to story. These days you don't need this.

Windows uses a virtual address space and page tables and whenever you ask for memory, you're given memory, even if it's not available yet, and then, as you access memory, windows underneath will load in and out, will redirect your use of memory to an actual physical memory in RAM. So you may think you have, you know, a gigabyte of memory that your program is using Really. It may be using far less than that of actual RAM and the rest is all virtual.

But back then we had to do this. And I like talking about this because it's one of those things that when people talk about how video game development was different back then and it took longer and or it didn't take longer, it required a different skill set. Like, if I were to make Fallout now in Unity, I could make it much faster and probably with a smaller team. But back then we were building everything from scratch And some of the stuff we were doing was so low level, so right above the metal um, that you needed a really good skill set on optimization and codewriting to even get a game out the door. It was 100% required back then, so I thought I'd talk about this because it's really fun And also when you think about: hey, what took Fallout — you know what was, what was a lot of time spent on Fallout and what was bug fixing like and what kind of optimizations did you have to do This?

Was a big one. Getting Fallout running with its own memory model was a big one. And once we got that working it solved just a ton of other issues. We stopped running out of memory. Uh, the game could run on lower spec machines.

Just a lot of problems were solved by just having one big block and we allocated from it ourselves. So I thought that was interesting enough to talk about. Hope you liked it.
