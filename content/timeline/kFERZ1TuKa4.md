Hi everyone. It's me, Tim. Today I want to talk about challenges facing an, Arcanum remaster.

I did a video like this — challenges facing a Fallout remaster — couple months ago. It was popular, there was a lot of comments and many of them said, "Hey, I'd rather have an Arcanum remaster" And I thought: well, I made an Arcanum remake video, which I'll also link below. But this is a remaster. This is about: hey, let's take the original code and just fix bugs and make it work on modern hardware and get it optimized, not let's make a 3D version of Arcanum with lasers H, let me write down lasers. Okay, this video is probably going to be kind of long because whoever chooses to do this remaster of Arcanum, you got your work cut out for you. Also, it's long because I can be very, very specific. I own the code. I've looked at the code. I looked at the code for a few hours before making this video because I wanted to make sure.

Like, do I remember this correctly? I want to make sure I understand everything. And let me just tell you, because of the code and some other things, just remaking or remastering Arcanum is going to be a legally complex issue. Let me spell it out before I dive into the remaster: specifics themselves, The IP, meaning everything that's Arcanum: the, name, the setting, the world, the stories, the characters, the mechanics, all that, All that was owned by Sierra, who then went, got purchased by Javis, which got purchased by Activision, which is now owned by Microsoft. And you must, you guys may be going great, Tim, you're working at a Microsoft company, but — and this is a very big butt and you know I like big butts — The code is owned by Troa, which is now me, and Leonard Barski and Jason Anderson.

And we cannot by the original publishing agreement. Release it. We own it, but we can't just release it. And if somebody wanted to remaster — meaning I'm assuming they want the code — We're not talking a remake here, We're talking a remaster — They want to use that code, They will have to negotiate with me and Leonard Berski and Jason Anderson, to all three of our satisfaction, before they can use the code, because they don't own it. Oh, you don't think you want the code?

Great, You're probably making a remake. You want to go watch my thoughts on an Arcanum remake video? So go watch that, so now, that I've got that out of the way, by the way, since I own the code, I have recompiled it myself. I made it into a Windows 10 app. I've got a video about that. Um, some of the things I ran into was: there was Seur ROM, which was the stuff.

On disc to do copy protection. That was gone, first thing I wiped. Well, I didn't wipe it, I recompiled a fresh one that Securrom was not applied to.

But then I ran into multiplayer, which was through Sierra's multiplayer network called Juan W, Not one but Juan, I don't know why. Anyway, ripped that out because that doesn't exist anymore and I didn't want to deal with the network code. So the one I remade wasn't um, or the one I remastered wasn't a, didn't have multiplayer. And let me just tell you, when I recompiled that code on a modern compiler — I mean it was made on Visual Studio, but I think back when Visual Studio was numbered six and now it's up to like 17 or 18, it recompiles with a ton of warnings, Tons of warnings. So just warning you programmers out there, We did a lot of stuff which it didn't complain about back then, like using an enum as an integer.

Now it's like: nope, you better cast that or we're going to throw a warning. It's trivial to cast it And it works just fine to cast it And then once you put it, you know an intum it's happy as a clam to do whatever it is you're asking. You've got to do that in literally thousands of lines of code because it didn't matter then matters now. So once you've gotten over that horror, um, let's start with talking about bugs. To fix Arcanum ship, as I've said this as kind of an alpha, there are lots of bugs. The bugs just aren't in code, although there are a lot in code. There's a lot of bugs in the scripts, which was our own internally made script language, which I called sock monkey.

I looked at that. I couldn't find any.

Bugs in the script code, but I did find scripts that had bugs in them that scriptors had made with sock monkey script maker. There's also bugs in the dialogue files. Our dialogue files are very complex. I have a whole video on arcanum dialog files so you can go look at that. You can do lots of things in the dialogue. You can send out a lot of op codes which give the player, which finish quests and adjust reputation and give money and items and all these things And there are bugs in there that the people who wrote the dialogue did. That's going to have to be fixed. There's also a lot of assets that may need some fixing.

Um maps, Um, I don't mean the map itself, but the map has embedded things like when you put a door in, you can say this door transitions to this. I think we have little bits and pieces that are mistaken there, like some. Some seem to remember some place that had a bad transition condition. So those will have to be checked. That gets you into optimization. Uh, we made optimizations that were good for the hardware in 2001,, which was many, many years ago.

Look how gray I am. You know that my computer I ran this on doesn't even work anymore. It exploded decades ago, so, just like things like the art blitter, a blitterous thing that writes pixels up, Yeah, Arcanum still worked with. Pixel was not 3D objects. That was optimized for the hardware back then.

It's not how we would do it now. Memory management was optimized for us doing it ourselves and optimized for the size of memory we had back then for the minspec. That would probably be made higher now. You could improve that.

It ran on whatever version, of DirectX was back then. Whatever version now probably has optimizations and improvements and extensions that you could take advantage of. I know we had to do things like just underlining text had to be done by ourselves manually and then blitted manually, and not something you could. You could throw out with a direct call going. Here's the string, by the way. I want it underlined, so that's stuff that could be done as well.

Then we get into game balancing. Um, there's a whole bunch of game balancing.

Remember I mentioned that — that Arcanum shipped in its alpha state. So we shipped with a lot of things we never intended it to ship with. We never made a balance pass through the spells.

That's why harm is crazy powerful. There's also, um, I have a whole video on why I wanted to ship with attributes and spells and skills costing multiple points as they got higher And we switched to a onepoint method. By the way, a lot of you convinced me in that video that you like the onepoint method. Well, that's good. I would still like to add the multi-point back, maybe, as there's a — maybe there's a option somewhere going Tim's version of Arcanum, and it would list a bunch of things that I felt needed to be changed from the base game, which would definitely include this. Then we could talk all day about real time versus turn-based combat inside Arcanum — and I do have a video about that as well. But let me just summarize it by saying real time was way too frenetic, way too crazy fast, bizarre, uncontrollable.

I would fix that. I would also put in turn-based options. There's a lot of stuff in turn-based. I wish I had the time to do, like um, all the enemies that are sequenced adjacently. Get to go together in one turn, or maybe just all the enemies only do one initiative roll and they all take the same turn.

And that way things are just a lot faster. Turnbased could be a lot faster, rather than you go and wait for all these other enemies to go. It's like you go, they all go way faster. All go, you go, they all go way faster.

Um, you know what I was going to talk about: quality of life, but I will throw that into some UI stuff. But let's talk about art real fast. This is going to be short because I'm not an artist and I'm color blind and I didn't do any of the art for the base game. But let me just tell you a few things that caught my eye as I looking through the archives. I don't have a single piece of original.

Art archived. Leonard and Jason archived all of that and I believe Jason. Well, let me rephrase that I know Jason had the backups. I do not know if those backups are still viable. I've moved all my backups years ago into the cloud, where they are safe and they float around, and I've even said: if the cloud s — uh, if the cloud service I use goes under, well, I have it mirrored to a hard drive. If my hard drive explodes, I've got it in the cloud. The only way it can be lost now is if the cloud and my hard drive both go away at the same time.

I don't know what's going on with art. And the reason I bring it up is to make an Arcanum remaster. I think it should work better in higher resolutions And that would require just taking some the original source art and just rerendering it at a higher resolution so it look nicer. Especially, you want to do that for the cinematics. But I would love to have that done for just everything in the game: The characters, the props, creatures. Speaking of that, I would love to get more variety in some places. I thought we had pretty good variety in the creatures but scenery, like when you go walk around in the woods and stuff. We only had a few trees and that's because. We could only keep a few trees loaded. We could add a lot more of those trees, rocks, flowers, tile, patterns and just keep a lot more in memory, because we have a lot more memory these days. So you'd see a lot more variety in the world And I think that would make maps, and especially the procedurally generated maps, look a lot less sy I.

In addition, we had a bunch of really cool facades. I see video people now call them. When people talk about our game. They call them set pieces. We call them facades.

That's things like a giant piece of artwork that you can't walk over. It's not tile but it's done as tiles. It's broken into tiles that look like a castle or the crashed blimp or a dragon skeleton lying on the ground. Those were done as facads. Not only would I want — definitely want — to upres those things, it would be fun to make more and just throw them into random encounters. So there's a more — not more — variety of places you can find in the world, but you have more of those facades.

We literally didn't have time to make them and we didn't have the disk space to store them in and the memory to load them into. We'd have all that today And I don't think that would dramatically change. I think that would qualify as a remaster. You just have a lot more interesting set pieces. That gets me into UI, which I do want to talk about.

Quality of life at this point. There's a lot of things you can do with the user interface to make it feel more modern and smoother. The first thing I thought of was I wish I put in hold down tab and it lights up all the items in the area. Things like making you user interface elements, making it easier for the player to do targeted attacks in combat or using fate points or controlling companions. Just make that easier.

It's already in the game. It's just hidden under bad user interface elements. By the way, key rebinding standard now wasn't then Would throw that in. Maybe you would like to play Arcanum with a controller. Maybe we could figure that out.

Text resizing has to go in We only made it run in 800 by 600 and we picked a decent text for the size of monitors that existed. That in the day I would want to do text resizing. While we're talking about UI, I would definitely take the original UI and break it up into pieces so that they could be repositioned like pushed out, like if you increase the resolution of the screen, it would take the elements and push them out into the corners, things like that. It makes the user interface, not just something you can resize and reposition, but you could also choose to let people make it semi-transucent. We, by the way, use the UI to reduce the part of the screen we actually had to draw to every frame so we could get our frame rate higher.

Don't really need. That today. Some final things sound. I went through the game and I realized we didn't have a lot of sound effects because we couldn't keep a lot of sound effects loaded — way more sound effect variety, especially in combat — uh, creature attacks, just put in a lot more stuff there. And also we didn't VO a lot of the characters.

And now, because we could if we had the budget to do VO and the, dialogue is locked. We're just doing a remaster, we're not doing a remake, it's locked dialogue. It would be pretty straightforward to just have a voice actor come in, read the dialogue and have more voiced characters in the game. Maybe even all the characters in the game are voiced. Have to figure out how to handle generated dialogue. Got a video on generated dialogue but there are ways around that And I think you could do it.

Especially if the company that was publishing it had a big budget. Anyway, wow, so that's. I went over optimization and art and UI and balancing and bug fixing. I think those are all the main challenges that would face someone who was trying to do an Arcanum remaster today. Anyway, hope you like this.
