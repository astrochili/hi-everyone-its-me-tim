Hi everybody. It's me, Tim. Today I want to talk about getting jiggy with it or, more specifically, the application of jiggy oriented procedures to a variety of activities In particular.

Wait, actually today I'm answering a question about single versus multiplayer RPG designs. This question comes from Games by Mark Wolf, who asked: "Here's a question for you, Tim: What are the pros and cons of solo RPGs versus multiplayer RPGs? Is there a difference? Further discussion point. My answer to the second question is that I would argue a solo RPG, if it amounts to nothing else, is an incomplete design.

Let's dive into that. I think it's a real interesting question. I started answering it in the comments and then went: "No, I'm going to make a video and explain my answer to Games by Mark Wolf". By the way, don't make fun of how I say Wolf, That's how I pronounce woof.

Anyway, I thought I had covered this. I could have sworn I covered this. I actually went and looked to.

Find the video to link in my answer And it turns out what I covered was single player games that are that are solo versus party based. So it's one person, one single player, controlling either a character by themselves or controlling a whole party. But this question is about single player versus multiplayer. So playing games where there's just one person in the RPG and games where there's lots of people. I would like everybody listening to this to bear in mind I've only made one RPG that had both single and multiplayer in it, and that was Arcanum. But I did spend six years working on an MMO That was Wildstar: Three years as programming director and three years as design director. So all of this is giving me some thoughts of how to answer this question.

Let's look at the pros and cons of single player RPGs And then, of course, multiplayer RPGs. Are just these things reversed?

So let's look at the pros first. And I've decided, I've divided that into design, code art and testing — All the pros of doing single player RPGs. Design has by far the most pros, because a lot of the other ones are like: "Oh, because the design's easy, my job is easy". So let's start with design. Pros of single player role playing games. First of all, you can make a story that reacts to just one person And since story is what you're going to do right after you come up with setting, this is something you're going to be thinking about right away when you're designing your RPG. A lot of single player games let the player be special or even unique. And you cannot do that in a multiplayer game because you can't have a thousand chosen ones running around all fulfilling prophecy, because there's thousands of them.

Then related to the story thing are quest design. Quest design can be so much simpler in single player role playing games. You don't have to concern yourself with players at different stages of quest completion. So let's say I come in and I accept a quest, Let's say I even achieve it, I just haven't turned it in yet. And then my buddy shows up and he wants to do the same quest.

What is the game supposed to do? We're supposed to recover the magic dagger. I've already got it.

Can we? Can he just join my group? We can go turn it in and we both get credit. Or does he have to go get his own dagger and then we both turn it in? Or do I have to get rid of my dagger and restart the quest with him and be both recover daggers again?

You're going to have to figure. This out in a multiplayer game And I guarantee you, no matter which solution you pick, there are going to be some gamers that don't like that solution. By the way, this opens up a can of wor, a can of worms, for all your design.

How are you going to handle cases where players quit in the middle of a combat or in the middle of a quest or in the middle of a dungeon? I literally had in EverQuest? We were. We decided to go on a big adventure to a dungeon that you had to go, one. You had to fight your way through an entire floor and then there was a key to a door to get into the second floor and the person who had that key quit before we got there. So everything was a waste because we couldn't move on without the one person who had that key and he quit.

That doesn't happen in single player games. You don't have to worry about that. If the player quits, the game is shut down. So you don't have to worry about those things.

More so you can have turn-based combat or really long dialogues that are oneonone between the player and an NPC, or any number of design elements that focus attention of the game on one particular player character. You can't or shouldn't — or good luck making it fun — have those design elements in a multiplayer game, especially an MMO. Try having turn-based combat in a world with a thousand players running around. One person gets into combat and everybody waits.

That's why they do instances, Instances temporarily t change MMOs into just multiplayer or even solo. That's why those things even exist, but one really important thing to keep in mind: for single player RPGs I have an entire video about how you frequently make unique roles for the player that you don't let NPCs have. Things like knocking out an NPC or stunning them, or even one hit kills. You love that as a player, but you don't want that happening to You may not be able to have that in multiplayer because you do not want the players doing it to each other. So you end up either saying, "We're not going to support player com, player versus player combat, so no PVP". Or you end up having what I complain about in that video, which is: "Okay, here's a set of rules you have as a player. Oh, but these particular skills and abilities and spells they don't work on other players. They do this other thing on other players and it gets very confusing very fast".

So in single player you don't have to worry about that. It's there are no other players, It's just you. So then you can. You know you don't have to worry about having PvP at all, which leads to probably one of the biggest design bonuses of single player that you can possibly imagine, which is no griefing There's. No matter how carefully you design your game, no matter how much you try to protect players from other players being malicious, griefing is super, super hard to prevent. If you drop an item and another player can pick it up, griefing can happen. If players can talk to other players, you can have griefing because one go: "Oh yeah, that zone is safe for level two players.

You should go on in. I got your back. Hey, I'll take, I'll walk you across the bridge, You'll be fine" Griefing. You don't have to do that in a single player game And because of that you don't have to spend tons of design time and then code time and art time and testing to put in anti — griefing features. Do not underestimate how much griefing has to be planned for in multiplayer games, which then let's, go to code, because I think that's. That's enough for design, first of all, single player RPGs have much simpler code. Overall, I would say single player RPGs are complicated code-wise, but they're way simpler than multiplayer for all the reasons I just said.

Simpler design leads to simpler code. It's that easy, but then, beyond that, there's a whole bunch of other things that just pop out as better in code. You can have much simpler AI in single player because it doesn't have to well, two things: It doesn't have to split focus and priorities and possible combat attacks between multiple uh players, potentially hundreds of players, because you may want to do a raid.

But also — and I talked about this in Arcanum when you went out in, the world map was the entire world map. The world map was the entire world. We lo, we demand, loaded it as you went in So we had to decide how many, how much CPU cycles, how many ticks per heartbeat for all those creatures that were out there to devote to their AI.

That's just much simpler in single player, because there's only one person and there's not radius around that one character, or there's one party that you that tend to stay clustered together. Most single player party games — you can't spread your characters across maps. Multiplayer games: they usually want to do that, They expect to do that. They're at least spread out when you get into open world maps And then suddenly your poor server is doing a lot more work to keep everything active, to keep everything. Animated and just have its AI working — the animation usually on the client, but having them walk and any combat code is now being activated in droves. We did a heat map once on a on our world map server and it was like watching gas spread out in a container. People just spread out on the open world like they're trying to occupy the entire volume.

Single player code doesn't need networking code. Networking code is hard. Networking programmers are specialists and hard to find And you don't need one for single player RPGs. You don't have to worry about instancing dungeons, because even if you let the single player have a party he doesn't have to use, you usually don't let him split them up across instances. You don't have to worry about having a server or banks of servers to manage activation of ton of those AI units or to spread the load of all these players across multiple servers and then to coordinate data between those and login between those. All that gone, Don't have to worry about it in single player. I think that's most of the code.

Let's talk about art. Real fast Art.

The big thing I can think of was if you're playing single player, then everything I talked about in my first third person video applies, which is you won't need as many PC animations. If you're first person, you may not need any at all And if you're in third person, far reduced detail on animations and textures. Not true for multiplayer, because if you have a lot of players running around, they can see the other players. You're going to have to have those animations in there, Whether they're picking a lock or, you know, opening a, door or port color or whatever you're probably. Going to have animations you wouldn't have needed in single player.

This leads to testing which, just h. If you ever want to aggravate a QA person, start talking to them about multi-player test plans. Single player is so much simpler, For all the reasons I've just said. Simpler design, simpler code, simpler art requirements lead to simp. Simpler testing. There's just far less to test. Uh, because of that, it's also much easier, because the testing plans are not any simpler and more straightforward.

Even though you may have a nonlinear design. There's no need for group testing. You don't have to say, "Well, how did this dungeon work with two people, with three people, with five people, with 10 people? There's no need for 1,000 to 2,000 serverwide tests, of having everybody log in at once and try to go through the same zones and try to access the same.

Vendor, especially if the vendor is not in an instance. I played a, an online game, once where when you created a character, you had to go talk to an NPC in a non-instanced area and when the when the MMO first opened and there were literally a thousand people making characters at once and jumping in, you couldn't even see the NPC. It was just a mass of people and you couldn't even see them to click on them. It was a mess. I was like why didn't they instance this? Or we all had communication devices?

Couldn't I just called the NPC? But anyway, the let's jump in. I've said so many about the pros because you don't, and they're usually hey, you don't have to do this.

Let's talk about specific cons with single player. The obvious one is you can't share the experience. You can't play with your friends, Of course not. It's single player.

That's a huge con. A lot of people expect that in their games. Now They want to play games with their friends. Single player can't do that, but there's more than that. Your stories, your combat encounters, your puzzles — they're all very limited in scope, because you can't do big fights against multiple bosses. That need tight coordination between people, because the best you can do in a single player is either the player's controlling a party and can only divide their attention so quickly, or it's a or it's single. It's a solo player character and all the fighting is happening with him and maybe he has some companions. Maybe he can control them, maybe he can't. It's you have to put in everything that's solvable by one person And if you think well, you can always do that, you know, especially if you have a solo party.

Well, what if you? Have a puzzle that requires pulling three levers simultaneously or hitting a monster simultaneously with fire, frost and shock? You can't really do that in single player because they have to click on each character and there will be a delay. Even if it's real time with pause, there'll be a delay between those things going off. In real time you can coordinate stuff like that. You can make some really interesting puzzles because of that. You can make puzzles where you pull a lever and then there's a particular amount of time someone has to get in and just all kinds of cool things you can do, especially if you have multiple of those.

The other problem with single players: unless you allow jack-of alltrade player characters, frequently with no level cap, some content — or content resolution, I should say — will go unseen. They will never see the stealth path here. They will never see.

The speech path here, because they simply couldn't make a character that does all those things. There are people who won't buy single player games that don't let them see all the content with one character on one playthrough. Um, this also means you may have less replay value in single player games. In multiplayer games, just playing with other people increases the replay value much less — trying out different classes, jumping on different servers, with different rules. So that you get a lot less replay value solo-wise. And then finally, um, I mentioned that you don't have PvP as an advantage.

It's also a disadvantage. Some people like PvP. They say, "I've never met more clever adversaries than fighting other people". No AI can ever be as clever as other people.

So they like PvP, and you're not going to get that in single player RPGs because there is no PvP. As for uh, the part of the question about single player um being an incomplete design, I said online. I left a comment saying I I think that assumes multiplayer encompasses all of the single player stuff, and I think this, what I just said, shows how I disagree with that. I think they are separate design spaces with a lot of overlap. But there are things you can only see in single player, just like there are sing things you only see in multiplayer.

There are things that one of one of them shines at that the other doesn't, and vice versa. So I think that answers my question. Oh, I talked for a long time and I hope games by Mark Wolf. This answers your question.
