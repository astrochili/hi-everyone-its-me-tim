Hi everyone. It's me, Tim. Today I want to talk about the joy of doing.

I want to tell you a story today. Well, this, is going to go out as a fun Friday story. So it's really just me telling a long story with a moral at the end, I guess [snorts]. But today is Monday, ironically, and this story just happened yesterday, which was a Sunday, which is kind of important to the story. But I'm digressing, I'm going to tell the story.

So it was Sunday morning yesterday. I had gotten home from the store. It was around 8:30 in the morning. You know I I don't sleep well. I tend to get up early. I really love shopping early on Sundays because the stores are empty, there are very few customers. Usually I'm there and me and the few other customers outnumber all the employees in the store.

Usually they're in either a good mood or a quiet mood, which suits everybody. I like it. Don't forget I'm an introvert.

That's my jam, so I had just gotten home and I was putting stuff away and I got a text from a friend. It just said, quote: "I have a Python question". Now, Python is a scripting language. I have not used it in years and then I only used it as a scripting language in one or two of my games that were coded in C++. So my knowledge of Python isn't that deep, but I know it, I've done It's one of those things that I usually between just knowing a lot of programming stuff in general and having worked a few times in Python, I figured I could, I can figure it out. But the other reason I said "Yeah, let's do this" is my friend is a doer.

He doesn't talk about doing things. He doesn't ask vague questions like "Hey, Tim, can you explain microode to me". Because if that had, been it, I would have been like "Yeah, busy store".

But he loves doing projects. He's always making something and it's always something different and interesting. And when I say he loves doing projects, it's not just a particular kind of thing, It's not. He doesn't like make a table or paint it or whatever. He is really broadsp spectrum.

He will purchase hardware and tools for the project he wants to work on. He will wire breadboards, He will 3D print mounting for those breadboards or even housing for his entire project. So when he's done, the device he builds has a unique, specialized mounting and device it sit uh housing that it sits in.

So when he asked for help, I knew it was very specific. He in fact he said when I talked to him I need to know how to do this one thing in Python And I'm like: great. And let me just stop here and say, if a friend of mine needs very specific help and has already tried to solve it themselves, I'm definitely going to help. It's when they've done absolutely nothing and they want vague help for everything. That's when I usually say "No, I'm busy, I can't help you". And it's because you can really fall into a rabbit hole of doing all this work for someone who just wants to be an idea person — And let me tell you, there's probably a hundred of those people for everyone who will literally roll up their sleeves and do something. So it's, basically the rule: I'm not going to put more effort into your project than you're putting into your project. So that does not apply to this friend.

He has already been he. I'm sure that by the time he decided to ask me that very spec, specific Python question, he must have done a lot of work already, because he's not primarily a programmer. So the fact that he already had figured out what language to use and he had already written code, that told me, okay, he's done a lot of work already. So, because I knew it was very specific, we just jumped into a video call and we started talking and the first thing I asked him before we dove into the particular line of Python is I said: what is it that you want to do? Describe to me what you're trying to get done here. So he described what he, what his device was, that he was making a very high level, and then I asked him what he had tried to do like what are the different things you tried to do to get this to work? And he had a lot of answers. I mean, he had tried a lot of different things then and only then did I say: can you show me the code. So he sent me the code and we started going through it. And the first thing I did is looked at the fundamentals. I didn't look at the highest level stuff. I looked at how he initialized the chips on his breadboard I. I looked at how they got state, how they stored state [snorts].

Only then did I say: okay, he had some debug prints in his Python code. So I said: "Can let's run it and show me exactly what's coming out the other end". So we looked at the output, one line at a time, because let me tell you something. We saw a line, and then we saw another line and then, on the very third line that got printed out, I went stop. That shouldn't have happened. It what it's saying is not it had basically asked for at a very fundamental level.

It had called a get state method and it wasn't working. What it returned was a nonvalue. It was something it couldn't do anything with.

It's like when you ask something to open a file and you get a null, or you know you say how many files do you have, and it says zero, or actually it doesn't give. Zero goes — I can't tell you how many files I have, which is different than zero. That's why null isn't zero. Zero might be how many files you have. I know how many files I have. It's zero, which is very different than how many files do you have? Null, I don't know how many files I have.

That's very different than zero. This was similar. One of his fundamental get state.

Methods didn't work, so we're like, well, that's strange, Let's go online and look at this. We went to the firmware of the chip he was using and one of the things we noticed that it there was lots of versions of this firm firmware. Some had this method, some didn't have this method — and we looked and the version of his firmware for this chip didn't have the method. So we went back online and at this time we looked at the schematic for the actual chip. This means we looked at the pins that were on the chip, that were in the breadboard that he had wires coming out of, to see what the lines in and out actually did. At that point we realized that in theory, this chip should have been able to do what my friend was asking, but it wasn't doing it.

The current firmware that he had. On there wasn't doing it, so we thought, you know what, Let's look for an update. And right then I'm going to stop you and go.

There could be four possibilities to the result of our search. Either we could say there's firmware out there — Um well, I'll tell you now, there's four possibilities to the fact that we couldn't find any firmware. Either it's out there and it's been done and it works on this chip, but we couldn't find it. Maybe we're just bad with searching, or the firmware can been done, can and had been done, but nobody had put it online.

Maybe it's something you had to go and buy and then people would. You would give it to you. It could be that it could be done, but no one's ever done it. So the option there would be: we could write our own firmware. Notice, this is not a small. Task, This is a huge task. Let's write firmware for a new, for a chip, um, with only using the schematics of the, pins, or the fourth pos possibility. Firmware can't be written for this chip to do this thing At this point.

You know we were, we had been at this for a long time and one of us looked at a clock and realized 2 and 1/2 hours had gone by. I told you I got home at 8:30 and he pinged me. I spun up a call right before 9 and it was already 11:30.. We had been doing this for 2 and 1/2 hours And part of it is it's. You know, looking at code takes a while, Doing the searches took a while. Running through a schematic of a of a chip takes a while.

It's not like you glance at it and go. I understand this whole. Chip. We had to go through it pin by pin. He apologized and I said: "No, It was a lot of fun doing this". I said: "This is something I don't do very often. It's some of the stuff I didn't know, Some of it I did know. I knew enough to know what I didn't know which helped guide the search which I've talked about. Sometimes knowing what you don't know is super useful". Plus, I pointed out that he understood the problem way better than when we started. He was like: started When we started, he was like: "I don't understand.

The Python code looks fine and it's not. My device isn't working", well, now he understood way more what the problem was And he had three different ways of proceeding. He could look for the firmware out there. Maybe we had done a bad job of finding it, or maybe it was for sale so it was behind a payw wall somewhere.

Or he could redesign his device so that, now that he knew what that chip he had could do, he could redesign his. Redesign his device to only be based on things that the chip could actually do with the firmware that was on it. Or, third option, he could go look for a different chip, Buy that, find a chip, confirm that the firmware did what he wanted, put it into his device, run the same Python code and he could be done.

In the end we were both happy. But I want to point [clears throat] out that from a production standpoint, nothing had been achieved. It was two and a half hours later and still the device didn't work. There wasn't a line of new code written. There had been no measurable forward progress. But we were both happy because we understood. The problem better and we had options and how to go forward.

This is what I've always tried to tell people on this channel. For me, the joy in video games was always in the making, the doing, not the finishing or even sometimes the playing. And that's why I tell people I get so many questions about games I've made. Whether it was Fallout or Arcanum or The Outer Worlds, irrespective of the final game, my joy was more in the making than the final result, shipping or even the playing. So that's what this whole fun Friday talk has been about. I wanted to walk you through something that wasn't video games but was still kind of in my wheelhouse and just talk about how much fun it was to spend two and a half hours playing around with a friend's device project that he was working on — Super fun — Exactly what I like doing. If you like doing this too, you might like video games, making video games. Anyway, have a fun Friday.
